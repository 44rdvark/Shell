# Shell
This project contains an implementation of a simple Unix shell written by me as a part of Operating Systems course. The files builtins.c, mshell.c and utils.c are my own contribution to the project, the rest (command parsers) was provided by the course supervisor.

## Running the project
Make the project using Makefile located in [shell](shell) directory, then run the mshell executable.
